### Package required
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
We recommend using the latest version of Python. Flask supports Python 3.8 and newer.
```
pip install Flask
```
MongoDB is an open-source database that saves data in flexible JSON-esque "documents" with variable fields, names, and structures, rather than in traditional rows found in relational databases.
Flask-PyMongo bridges Flask and PyMongo and provides some convenience helpers.
```
pip install Flask-PyMongo
```

config is a hierarchical, easy-to-use, powerful configuration module for Python
```
pip install config
